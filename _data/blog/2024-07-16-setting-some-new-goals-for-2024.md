title: Small steps for big change
---
I know more than half a year has passed, but a lot has happened in the first few months. I haven't had the energy to set any goals for this year yet. I've been working at a new company for two months now, and everything is pretty stable. I want to sit down and set my goals for the second half of the year.

In the past, I've set some pretty big goals, like studying abroad or starting a company. None of those have been successful. So this time, I'm going to take smaller steps.

The first thing I want to do is to get in shape. I've been going to the gym and working out at home pretty consistently lately. I have more control over the food I eat, but I haven't yet reached a healthy state. I did lose 3 kg, but my goal is to lose 3-5 kg more. Right now, I'm at 75.5 kg. I'm considering registering for the running competition at my company; it's about 1.7 km and 3.5 km. I will discipline myself more to reach that goal. It's not a big career goal, but it's an achievable goal that will benefit me greatly in the long term.

My other goal for this year is to learn German. I want to seriously take a German class and hopefully take a test to achieve at least an A2 level by the end of the year. I've been studying on Duolingo for about three months, but the progress has been very slow, and I know I can go at a faster pace. This goal will be a stepping stone if I decide to study abroad in the future.

Some people go big, but for me, in order to stay consistent, I will take small steps at a time. That's all for today. I hope you all the best, and tsch√ºss!
